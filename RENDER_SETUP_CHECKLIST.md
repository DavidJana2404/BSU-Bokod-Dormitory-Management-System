# ‚úÖ Render Deployment Checklist

## Step-by-Step Guide

Your code has been pushed to GitHub! Now follow these steps:

---

## 1. Wait for Render Auto-Deploy ‚è≥

Render will automatically detect your GitHub push and start deploying.

**Monitor Progress:**
- Go to: https://dashboard.render.com
- Select your web service
- Watch the **Logs** tab for deployment progress

---

## 2. Add Email Environment Variables üìß

While deployment is running (or after), add these 8 variables:

**Go to:** Your Service ‚Üí **Environment** tab ‚Üí **Add Environment Variable**

### Add These Variables:

| Key | Value |
|-----|-------|
| `MAIL_MAILER` | `smtp` |
| `MAIL_HOST` | `smtp.gmail.com` |
| `MAIL_PORT` | `587` |
| `MAIL_USERNAME` | `admiraldavid71@gmail.com` |
| `MAIL_PASSWORD` | `wkcd vzyp xlpc qiva` |
| `MAIL_ENCRYPTION` | `tls` |
| `MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS` | `admiraldavid71@gmail.com` |
| `MAIL_FROM_NAME` | `Dormitory Management System` |

**Important:** After adding all variables, click **Save Changes** and Render will redeploy automatically.

---

## 3. Wait for Redeploy ‚è≥

After saving environment variables, Render will redeploy your service (takes ~5-10 minutes).

---

## 4. Clear Caches üßπ

Once deployment is complete, clear Laravel caches:

**Option A: Using Render Shell**
1. Go to **Shell** tab in your Render service
2. Run:
```bash
php artisan config:clear
php artisan cache:clear
```

**Option B: Add a Route (Already exists if you have it)**
Visit: `https://your-app.onrender.com/clear-cache` in your browser

---

## 5. Test Email System üß™

### Test 1: Welcome Email
1. Log into your app
2. Go to Applications page
3. Approve a pending application
4. ‚úÖ Check if student receives welcome email

### Test 2: Password Setup Email
1. Go to Students page
2. Edit a student who has no password
3. Set up their password
4. ‚úÖ Check if student receives password setup email

### Test 3: Manual Student Addition
1. Go to Students page
2. Add a new student (without password)
3. ‚úÖ Check if student receives welcome email

---

## 6. Verify in Logs üìã

**Check Render Logs for:**
```
‚úÖ "Welcome email sent to student"
‚úÖ "Password setup email sent to student"
```

**If you see errors:**
- Check environment variables are correct
- Verify Gmail App Password is active
- See RENDER_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md for troubleshooting

---

## 7. Check Gmail Sent Folder üì¨

1. Log into `admiraldavid71@gmail.com`
2. Go to **Sent** folder
3. ‚úÖ Verify emails were sent

---

## Quick Verification Commands

Run these in **Render Shell** to test:

```bash
# Check email configuration is loaded
php artisan tinker --execute="echo config('mail.mailer');"
# Should output: smtp

# Test sending a simple email
php artisan tinker --execute="Mail::raw('Test', function(\$m) { \$m->to('test@example.com')->subject('Test'); }); echo 'Sent!';"
```

---

## Troubleshooting Quick Fixes

### ‚ùå "Connection refused"
**Fix:** Check `MAIL_HOST` and `MAIL_PORT` in environment variables

### ‚ùå "Authentication failed"
**Fix:** Verify `MAIL_PASSWORD` is the App Password (with spaces): `wkcd vzyp xlpc qiva`

### ‚ùå "Class not found"
**Fix:** Run `composer install` and clear caches

### ‚ùå Emails not arriving
**Check:**
1. Spam/Junk folder
2. Gmail Sent folder (to confirm they were sent)
3. Render logs for errors
